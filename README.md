## Description

This is an online shopping store which allows to sell and manage products. It is made with MERN stack. It implements many features like cart managing, CRUD operation on user profile, search feature, payment feature,etc. First I did a node server and implement api routes, models and controllers for user, products, orders, etc. Then, I used react-bootstrap library to create User Interface and I used react Hooks like useState, useReducer, useNavigate, useEffect to implement my app logic and manage data state.

## Stack

MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
